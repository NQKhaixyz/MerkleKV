MerkleKV is an eventually-consistent, distributed key-value database designed for speed, reliability, and operational simplicity. It uses an MQTT broker for rapid, real-time update propagation and a sophisticated **Merkle tree** anti-entropy mechanism to efficiently detect and repair data inconsistencies in the background.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **High Performance**: Built with Rust and the Tokio asynchronous runtime for low-latency and high-throughput operations.
* **Simple Text Protocol**: An easy-to-use, Memcached-like protocol for `SET`, `GET`, and `DEL` ... operations.
* **Fast Replication**: Updates are immediately published to an MQTT topic and broadcast to all peer nodes.
* **Efficient Synchronization**: Merkle trees allow nodes to verify data integrity by comparing a single root hash. Discrepancies are located with logarithmic time complexity ($O(\log n)$) without full data scans.
* **Self-Healing**: The anti-entropy mechanism runs periodically to automatically find and fix any data drift between replicas, ensuring the cluster converges to a consistent state.
* **Memory Safety**: Guarantees provided by the Rust compiler prevent common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and data races.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of a cluster of `MerkleKV` nodes. There is no leader node; all nodes are peers.

1.  **Write Path**: A client writes a value to any node. That node updates its local state and publishes the change to a shared MQTT topic.
2.  **Replication (Hot Path)**: All other nodes are subscribed to the topic and apply the change as soon as they receive the message.
3.  **Synchronization (Repair Path)**: In the background, each node periodically gossips with a random peer, comparing the root hash of their Merkle trees. If the hashes differ, they efficiently traverse the trees to find and repair the exact keys that are inconsistent.

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Rust Toolchain**: Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
* **MQTT Broker**: A running instance of an MQTT broker like [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) or [EMQ X](https://www.emqx.io/).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AI-Decenter/MerkleKV.git 
    cd MerkleKV
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3.  **Configure your nodes:**
    Create a `config.toml` file for each node you want to run. See the configuration section below for an example.

4.  **Run a node:**
    ```bash
    cargo run --release -- --config /path/to/your/node1.toml
    ```
    To see replication in action, run multiple instances on different ports, each with its own configuration file.

## üìö Usage (Client API)

You can interact with a `MerkleKV` node using any TCP client, like `netcat` or `telnet`. All commands must end with `\r\n`.

```bash
telnet localhost 7878
```bash
telnet localhost 7878
```
SET: Store a key-value pair.


```
SET user:100 jane_doe\r\n
OK
```
GET: Retrieve a value by its key.
```
GET user:100\r\n
jane_doe
```
DEL: Delete a key.
```
DEL user:100\r\n
DELETED
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The server is configured using a TOML file.

Example node1.toml:

```Ini, TOML

# Unique identifier for this node
node_id = "node-alpha"

# TCP address for client connections
bind_address = "127.0.0.1"
bind_port = 7878
# Address of the MQTT broker for replication
mqtt_broker_address = "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883"

```
## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
We have an exciting future planned for MerkleKV! Here are some features we're looking to add:

[ ] KeyValue Node: Each node is an independent server instance, holding a complete replica of the dataset.
[ ] InMemory Storage Engine: The core component responsible for the actual key-value data storage and the management of the Merkle tree structure.
[ ] Client Protocol Listener: A TCP listener that parses and handles client commands (SET, GET, DEL) using a simple, text-based protocol.
[ ] Persistent Storage: Integrate Sled for on-disk persistence.

[ ] Replication Module: Manages the connection to the MQTT broker for publishing local changes and subscribing to updates from other nodes.

[ ] Advanced Conflict Resolution: Implement Vector Clocks for more robust conflict handling.
