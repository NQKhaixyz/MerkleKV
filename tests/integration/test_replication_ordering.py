"""
MerkleKV Replication Adversarial Tests - Event Ordering and Consistency

This module tests the replication system's ability to handle out-of-order event delivery,
duplicate events, and timestamp-based Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) conflict resolution.

Test scenarios:
- Events delivered in different order than produced
- Multiple duplicate events with same op_id
- Events with equal timestamps (op_id tie-breaking)
- Events with future/past timestamps (clock skew scenarios)
- Burst of events with mixed ordering
