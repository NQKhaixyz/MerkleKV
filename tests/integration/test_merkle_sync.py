Anti-entropy and Merkle tree synchronization tests for MerkleKV.

Academic Purpose:
These tests validate the background        # Academic validation: Selective repair efficiency
        # Only divergent keys should be transferred, not entire keyspace

            f"Repair efficiency too low: {repair_efficiency:.1%}"
        )nization mechanisms that ensure 
eventual consistency in distributed MerkleKV clusters. The anti-entropy 
system uses Merkle trees to efficiently detect and repair data divergences 
between nodes, providing the theoretical foundation for strong eventual 
consistency guarantees.

Current Implementation Note:
MerkleKV currently uses MQTT-based replication rather than true anti-entropy
Merkle tree synchronization. These tests validate eventual consistency
through the available MQTT replication mechanisms while maintaining the
academic framework for future anti-entropy implementation.

Test Coverage:
- Divergence detection and repair between isolated nodes
- Selective synchronization of only affected key ranges  
- Last-Write-Wins conflict resolution during convergence
- Performance characteristics of large keyspace synchronization
- Recovery from extended network partitions

Distributed Systems Theory:
The tests implement validation of anti-entropy algorithms as described in 
Amazon's Dynamo paper, ensuring that temporary network partitions or node 
failures do not permanently compromise system consistency.
