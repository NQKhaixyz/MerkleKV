## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server startup timeout
```
TimeoutError: Server failed to start within 60 seconds
```
**Solution**: Check port conflicts with `lsof -i :7400-7500`, rebuild project

#### MQTT connection failed  
```
Failed to connect to MQTT broker
```
**Solution**: Check internet connection, try `MQTT_BROKER_HOST=localhost` with Docker

#### Test timing issues
```
AssertionError: Expected replication within 10s
```
**Solution**: Increase timeout in slow network environments, check broker latency

#### Resource exhaustion during chaos tests
```
OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files
```
**Solution**: Run `ulimit -n 4096` or use `--mode replication` without slow tests

#### Flaky adversarial tests
```
Random test failures in clock skew or ordering tests
```
**Solution**: Tests use deterministic seeds - if failing, check for system clock drift

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
RUST_LOG=debug pytest -v -s test_replication_ordering.py

# Run specific slow test
pytest -v -m "slow" -k "broker_outage" --tb=long

# Performance profiling
pytest -v --tb=no --benchmark-only test_replication_throughput_spike.py

# Test isolation debugging  
pytest -v -k "topic_isolation" --capture=no
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Custom broker (local Docker)
export MQTT_BROKER_HOST=localhost
export MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883

# Test timing adjustment
export REPLICATION_TIMEOUT=15  # seconds

# Topic customization
export MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX=my_test_prefix
```
