Adversarial Replication Tests for MerkleKV

This module implements stringent integration tests targeting the correctness
of MerkleKV's MQTT replication system under adversarial conditions.

CURRENT STATUS: MerkleKV's MQTT replication has a startup race condition that
causes partial replication failures. These tests are designed to detect and
validate the fix for this initialization timing issue.

Scholarly Intent:                 # Establish initial consistent state
        await harness.execute_write_command("restart_0", "SET restart_test_1 initial_value")
        await asyncio.sleep(8)  # Allow MQTT replication
        
        # Restart node_2 during replication traffic
        print("🔄 Restarting node during replication...")
        await harness.restart_node("restart_2")
        
        # Perform writes after restart (should replicate to restarted node)
        await harness.execute_write_command("restart_0", "SET restart_test_2 post_restart_value")
        await harness.execute_write_command("restart_1", "SET restart_test_3 from_node_1") foreground falsification of replication safety
claims by examining edge cases where subtle timing issues, race conditions,
or conflict resolution failures could lead to catastrophic inconsistencies.

Test Categories:
1. High-frequency concurrent write patterns with conflict resolution stress
2. Network partition simulation with recovery validation
3. Restart-during-replication robustness verification  
4. Causality violation detection through dependent operation sequences
5. Large payload replication stress testing
6. Cold-start and bootstrap replication validation
7. Replication loop and infinite cascade prevention

Each test documents: (i) target invariant, (ii) adversarial condition, 
(iii) oracle argument for detecting violations without false positives.
